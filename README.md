# Pac-Rabbit

# We plan on making a Pac-Man inspired game about a lone rabbit's journey through mazes to collect carrots to bring back home. We plan to try to use Tiled to create a 2D “platformer” as our game setting. Additionally introduce enemies that pace through the maze that deals damage to the player, in order to keep things simple, we don’t plan on introducing power ups that allow the player to kill the enemies. Instead we will be giving the player a health pool that decreases by X amount upon contact with enemies, so they must be strategic with their pathing to optimize health and carrots gathered. In the theme of simplicity we don’t plan on making different levels for the time being. Instead we will introduce a scoring system that takes into account how many carrots have been gathered in the maze and how much health the player has after they have completed the maze. This incentivizes replaying to get a higher score, getting better at the game, learning enemy pathing patterns, etc. Instead of powerups we may introduce a player thrown projectile to destroy enemies, this may make the maze too easy to get a max score, making the remaining health points count towards the max score irrelevant. We plan on only making one level of the maze.
